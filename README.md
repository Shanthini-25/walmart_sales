Walmart is one of the largest retail corporations in the world, and it regularly collects and analyzes sales data to make informed business decisions.
The Walmart sales dataset typically consists of a wide range of information related to the company's sales transactions. Here are some key components that might be included:
--> Store Information
--> Product Information
--> Sales Transactions
--> Financial Information
--> Promotions and Discounts
--> Customer Information
--> Geographic Data

Analyzing the Walmart sales dataset can provide valuable insights for optimizing inventory management, identifying popular products, evaluating pricing strategies, understanding customer preferences, and making strategic business decisions.

With these informations, I have also answered some of the questions regarding the Walmart Sales. 
1) Which store has minimum and maximum sales?
2) Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
3) Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate?
4) Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together.
5) Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
6) Build prediction to forecast demand.

Also plotting the relationship between,
1) fuel_price and year.
2) weekly sales and the store.
3) Store and the unemployment.

In addition to this, also developed a model to predict the future sales of the store.
